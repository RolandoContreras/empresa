                                <p>Firstly you should consult the person who introduced you or your project sponsor.</p>
                                <p>The compensation plan manual will be available for download soon.</p>
                                <p>You can also request clarification through support@wingsnetwork.com email.</p>

                                Is there any monthly cost I have to pay? 
                            </a>
                            <div>
                                <p>Yes.</p>
                                <p>All Members with Wings products packages must pay a monthly asset in accordance with their degree in Wings career plan (consult the compensation plan manual).</p>

                        </li>

                                <img class="image_icons_b" src="<?php echo site_url().'static/images/png/forward2.png';?>">
                                What happens if you stop paying the monthly asset?
                            </a>
                            <div>
                                <p>There is a feature in the backoffice that allows to the member that the monthly asset is automatically deducted from your balance.</p>
                                <p>There is a period of 180 days, after which, verifying the non-payment of the monthly asset, your account will be canceled.</p>
                                <p>However, if you don’t pay the monthly asset on the required day, your bonuses incomes will be suspended until you pay or until the 180 days are through and your account is cancelled.</p>
                                <p>At the time you pay the bonus, providing your account hasn’t yet being cancelled, you’ll start receiving your bonuses normally with no retroactive effects.</p>
                                <p>After the account is canceled, the only way you can go back to being a Wings Member is with a new account.</p>
                                <p>Your old account is unrecoverable.</p>
